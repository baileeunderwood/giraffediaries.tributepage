        <h2>Devotion To Research</h2>
        <p>
          An icon in cancer research, Dr. Clarkson has devoted his research to attempting to develop curative therapies for various types of cancer. For over 50 years his laboratory has been studying the cellular kinetics of growth and differentiation of normal, leukemic and other cancer stem and progenitor cells with the goal of developing improved forms of treatment. His most recent study was focusing on quiescent cancer stem cells and defective quorum sensing as important obstacles to curing cancer

          Quiescent cancer stem cells are resistant to most therapies and defective quorum sensing enables the transformed clones to revert to functioning as primitive semi-independent ecosystems in which the heterogeneous member clones are highly interdependent, and whose behavior is not simply dominated by the most aggressive clones. Rather the transformed clones may function as interactive aberrant cell societies which disregard conventional regulatory mechanisms responsible for limiting and maintaining normal homeostatic cell densities. Thus increasingly defective quorum sensing may permit both overexpansion and malignant progression of cancer cell populations.
